# Introduction

This documentation is authored in Markdown.
The source files are in folder `md` and script `generate_doc.py`
regenerates the notebooks in folder `doc` whenever it's executed.
The script uses [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io) to convert
a Markdown file to a Jupyter notebook.
