    "# Jollity User Manual\n",
    "\n",
    "Jollity is a small library of functions that process Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "They can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove HTML comments from Markdown cells.\n",
    "- Prevent cells from being deleted or edited.\n",
    "- Replace a mnemonic label with an URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jollity does _not_ convert notebooks from/to other formats,\n",
    "like Markdown, PDF and HTML.\n",
    "There are plenty of tools for that, including [pandoc](https://pandoc.org),\n",
    "[nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io), [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io),\n",
    "[nbsphinx](https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io) and [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jollity uses the `NotebookNode` class of the `nbformat` module to\n",
    "represent a notebook in memory.\n",
    "Each function takes an instance of that class and modifies it.\n",
    "To process your notebooks, you will need to write code like this:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "import jollity\n",
    "import nbformat\n",
    "\n",
    "# go through all notebooks in `folder` or a subfolder of it\n",
    "for file in glob.iglob('folder/**/*.ipynb', recursive=True):\n",
    "    notebook = nbformat.read(file, 4)   # 4 is the notebook format version\n",
    "    jollity.one_function(notebook)\n",
    "    jollity.another_function(notebook)\n",
    "    nbformat.write(notebook, file)      # overwrites the original file\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you wish to preserve the original,\n",
    "write the processed notebook to a different file or folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For an example of how to use Jollity, see script `generate_doc.py`.\n",
    "It reads the source Markdown files of this manual in folder `md`\n",
    "and regenerates the notebooks in folder `doc`.\n",
    "The script uses [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io) to convert\n",
    "a Markdown file to a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jollity functions log any warnings and errors as they process notebooks.\n",
    "By default, the warning and error messages are printed on the screen,\n",
    "but you can collect them in a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using a bash-like command line, you can type\n",
    "`python your_script.py 2> log_file` to redirect the messages,\n",
    "e.g. `python generate_doc.py 2> log.txt`.\n",
    "This will overwrite the log file every time you run your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, add the following to your script:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(filename='log.txt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will append the messages to the file, if it exists.\n",
    "In this way you can preserve the log of previous runs of your script.\n",
    "If you want the log file to start afresh every time you run the script, write\n",
    "```py\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(filename='log.txt', filemode='w')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remove comments\n",
    "When authoring, you may wish to keep notes, ideas, draft paragraphs,\n",
    "alternative exercise solutions, to-do reminders and similar kinds of text\n",
    "in the same file, rather than in a separate document.\n",
    "You can write such text within HTML comments,\n",
    "so that it isn't rendered in the notebook.\n",
    "However, readers will see the comments if they edit the cells.\n",
    "Jollity can remove them before you deliver the notebooks to your audience.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "jollity.remove_comments(nb)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function removes HTML comments from all Markdown cells in notebook `nb`.\n",
    "It only removes comments that start with `<!--`\n",
    "at the beginning of a line, preceded by at most three spaces.\n",
    "The line with the first closing `-->` is also removed, i.e.\n",
    "any text on the same line after the comment is discarded.\n",
    "```\n",
    "WARNING:Text after comment:...\n",
    "```\n",
    "This message warns that text `...` was deleted because it comes\n",
    "after closing a comment. The Markdown source of this manual has\n",
    "next an example that raises this message.\n",
    "```\n",
    "WARNING:Spurious end of comment:...\n",
    "```\n",
    "This message warns that line `...` has `-->` but no comment was open.\n",
    "This may be deliberate, as in the previous sentence,\n",
    "or the corresponding `<!--` isn't at the start of a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Add non-breaking spaces\n",
    "Text like 'Part&nbsp;1' and '23&nbsp;kg' should use non-breaking spaces.\n",
    "Jollity can automatically insert them.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "add_nbsp(nb, before:str, after:str)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function goes through the Markdown cells of notebook `nb` and\n",
    "replaces one or more spaces between a word and a digit\n",
    "with a single non-breaking space (`&nbsp;`).\n",
    "Arguments `before` and `after` must be Python\n",
    "[regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).\n",
    "They indicate which words come respectively before and after a number for\n",
    "a non-breaking space to be inserted. For example,\n",
    "`add_nbsp(nb, r'Unit|[Cc]ell', r'kg|m')` replaces the space before/after\n",
    "the digit in 'Unit&nbsp;1', 'cell&nbsp;4', '5&nbsp;kg, '3.25&nbsp;metres', '2&nbsp;ms' (milliseconds),\n",
    "'6&nbsp;marble columns', but not in 'unit 1', '5 cells', '3 KG', '3 and 5'.\n",
    "This function replaces spaces, it doesn't create them:\n",
    "it won't insert a non-breaking space in '3kg'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want any space before or after a digit to be replaced,\n",
    "omit the corresponding argument, e.g. `add_nbsp(nb, after=r'kg')`\n",
    "replaces spaces only in text like '3&nbsp;kg' and nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expand URLs\n",
    "If you use some URLs repeatedly or URLs that change regularly,\n",
    "like links to the current year's course webpage, Jollity allows you to define\n",
    "a dictionary of labels to URLs and use the labels in Markdown links.\n",
    "Having all URLs in one place makes it easier to update them.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "expand_urls(nb, url:dict)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function goes through all Markdown cells of notebook `nb` and,\n",
    "for each link `[text](label)` where `label` doesn't start with 'http',\n",
    "replaces `label` with `URL` if\n",
    "the pair `label:URL` occurs in the `url` dictionary.\n",
    "For example, `expand_urls(nb, {'ou':'https://open.ac.uk'})` replaces\n",
    "`[Open University](ou)` with `[Open University](https://open.ac.uk)`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "WARNING:Unknown link label:...\n",
    "```\n",
    "This message indicates that `...` occurs in a link but not in the dictionary.\n",
    "The example above generates this message because `ou` is not in the dictionary\n",
    "created by `generate_doc.py`."
